    <h1>My humongous pet</h1>
    <p>Allow me to introduce you to my dog, Snow!</p>
    <p>She's a <strong>St.Bernard</strong>, a breed of very large working dogs from the alps in Switzerland, France and Italy.</p>
    <p>Snow is currently 7 years, weighs 115kgs and is 75cm tall!</p>
    <p>She's the most gentle creature i've met in my lifetime, playful too!</p>
    <p>Its diet and excercise is really crucial given its fast growth rate and its weight.Failure to observe this will cause its bones to detiriorate.</p>

    <h2>Snow's playtime</h2>
    <p>She really enjoys three things. They are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Playing with my tennis ball!</li>
      <li>Jumping over water sprinklers in the morning as the water the lawn.</li>
      <li>Chasing brightly voloured birds</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Have i mentioned its furry and woolen coat! Oh my! ZSigh, Snow's everything!</li>
